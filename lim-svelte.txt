# lim-svelte (not sure about the naming. Suggest better names)

## Restrictions

- Use Node with ES6 with "node": ">=22.0.0"
- Use llm.config.js for configuration details.
- This will be published to npmjs.com as a package.
- Use llms.txt standard (https://llmstxt.org/)

## Purpose

Convert markdown file to markdown file that will be used for LLM (Large language model).

## Content of llm.config.js

This file need to have:
1. srcDir with a string, example “./src/routes/docs” where contains md files.
2. outDir with a string, example “./src/routes/llm”
3. ignore with a string or an array for h2 tag (##), example “## See also”, [“Some title”, “Another title”, “Another title 2”]
4. format with a string: "md"

## Structure of md file that will be converted to md file for llm

A sample markdown file will be attached.

## Functions

1. Use title in the front matter title to add the h1. e.g. # Svelte Accordion - Flowbite

2. if code block starts with svelte then remove all after svelte.
for example ```svelte example hideOutput should be ```svelte
Otherwise don't touch them, e.g. ```js, ```css, etc

3. If there is ignore from llm.config.js, remove all title and its content.

4. For `## See also` section, use `relatedLinks` in the top script tag to create a link. The format is the following:
e.g. const relatedLinks = ['/docs/components/buttons','/docs/components/button-group' ,'/docs/forms/input'];

- [Buttons](https://flowbite-svelte.com/llm/components/button.md)
- [Button-group](https://flowbite-svelte.com/llm/forms/input.md)
- [List-group](https://flowbite-svelte.com/llm/components/input.md)

5. For `## Component data` section, use lowercase of component_title in the front matter to look for contents of svelte file in the `./src/lib` directory. For example `component_title: Accordion`, look into the `./src/lib/accordion` to find `Accordion.svelte` and `AccorionItem.svelte. There is `src/routes/component-data` directory with `Accordion.json` and `AccordionItem.json` files. Please note that the extension is `.json` not `.svelte` in the component-data directory. 
Each json file has the following structure. 
```
{
  "name": "Accordion",
  "type": {
    "name": "AccordionProps",
    "link": "https://github.com/themesberg/flowbite-svelte/blob/main/src/lib/types.ts#L157"
  },
  "props": [
    ["children", ""],
    ["flush", ""],
    ["activeClass", ""],
    ["inactiveClass", ""],
    ["multiple", "false"],
    ["class: className", ""],
    ["transitionType", ""]
  ]
}
```

Using this json file content, create the following:

### Accordion

#### Types

[AccordionProps](https://github.com/themesberg/flowbite-svelte/blob/main/src/lib/types.ts#L157)

#### Props

- children: ""
- flush: ""
- activeClass: ""
- inactiveClass: ""
- multiple: false
- class: className: ""
- transitionType: ""

5. If you find <GitHubCompoLinks />, remove it.

6. Remove front matter and the top script section.
